	<p pid="a.970W.0/2">When there is a need to travel overseas, MOD charter aircraft will be used where possible. When this is not available, overseas travel will be arranged through Hogg Robinson Travel, under contract to the MOD, to ensure the best value for money is obtained. However, this is not exclusive, as overseas travel may be included as part of a training or privately arranged at very short notice.</p>

On this date Lundy Island, originally designated as a Marine Nature Reserve under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, automatically became our first MCZ.

	<p pid="a.980W.8/1">The refusal of the Burmese authorities to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) independent and unsupervised access to political prisoners remains a grave concern, particularly as the number of prisoners of conscience has doubled to over 2100 since the 'Saffron revolution' in autumn 2007. We continue to urge the military government to co-operate fully with the ICRC and allow an immediate resumption of prison visits.</p>
	<p pid="a.980W.8/2">The UN General Assembly highlighted their concern at the condition of prisons and urged the regime to comply with human rights law in a resolution passed in November 2009. Our Ambassador in Rangoon last raised the issue of independent prison access for the ICRC to the Burmese government in August 2009 during the last visit of the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Burma. Our Ambassador regularly raises the plight of political prisoners with Burmese ministers, and we remain in close contact with the ICRC on this issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.981W.5/1">In November 2009 the UK helped to secure a UN General Assembly Resolution on the human rights situation in Burma, which called on the Burmese authorities to undertake a transparent, inclusive and comprehensive review of the Constitution while fully engaging with the democratic opposition and ethnic groups. We believe that a process of dialogue involving all actors in Burma will ensure a sustainable transition to democracy. This view is shared by other members of the EU and the United States of America.</p>
	<p pid="a.981W.5/2">In the UN Security Council, we regularly test the level of consensus for action on Burma, and have succeeded in securing discussion and a number of important Presidential Statements since autumn 2007. We do not judge, however, that an attempt to secure a Security Council review on the 2008 Constitution now would be successful. A resolution on Burma tabled in January 2007 was vetoed by two Permanent Members of the Council and any attempt to invalidate the Constitution will suffer the same fate.</p>

	<p pid="a.986W.8/1">Piracy off Somalia is being tackled comprehensively across Government Departments in line with the Government's Somalia Strategy and in close co-ordination with international partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.986W.8/2">Over the last 12 months, the UK has contributed to three international counter-piracy operations: this has included the provision of the operation Headquarters and Operation Commander to the EU Naval Force (Operation ATALANTA); The common funded budget for Op ATALANTA in 2009-10, which is paid through the Athena mechanism, currently amounts to &#8364;17.64 million, with the UK share approximately &#163;1.15 million. The UK also provides a frigate, tanker, the Deputy Commander and staff to Combined Maritime Forces; and a frigate to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation Operation OCEAN SHIELD. Furthermore the UK also provides the UK Maritime Trade Organisation, co-ordinating the movement of merchant shipping and acting as a first point of contact for any ships attacked in the region. The cost of all Ministry of Defence counter piracy activity is not recorded centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.986W.8/3">It is widely recognised that the solution to piracy lies on land in Somalia through security, economic, and judicial development. As part of the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS) the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has led and funded two regional needs assessments missions including all key donors to discuss with Somali representatives and others in the region the priorities for capability development in the legal, judicial, penal and maritime security sectors. In line with the internationally agreed outcomes of these needs assessments, the UK and other partners are supporting security sector reform in the region, including assistance to coastguards that will improve maritime security in the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden. The FCO has also funded the participation of Somali representatives in CGPCS-related activity.</p>

	<p pid="a.989W.13/1">Latest figures show that the employment level in Wales increased by 6,000 on last quarter, to 1.304 million, an increase of 94,000 since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.989W.13/2">The Government's extra investment in jobs, education and training is making a real difference in Wales, helping people through the recession and preventing the kind of unemployment we saw haunt Wales in the eighties and nineties. This fragile recovery would be wrecked by the Tories.</p>

	<p pid="a.990W.5/1">South Wales Police have an excellent record on dealing with crime and antisocial behaviour. I would therefore like to see higher levels of public confidence, though I am pleased to note that latest figures from the British Crime Survey do show the number of respondents expressing confidence in delivery has increased by over 22 per cent. since last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.990W.5/2">The Policing White Paper contains a raft of measures aimed at improving public confidence in the Police across England and Wales. Where a force, such as South Wales, is performing well on dealing with crime but public confidence remains low, this could be due to a number of reasons. For example more work might need to be done to ensure the successful work taking place is being communicated effectively to the public. The commitments to information provision and holding public forums within the policing pledge should assist with this.</p>

	<p pid="a.994W.2/3">The ODA has a number of measures in place to address the effects of the works on air quality.

Air quality monitoring reports are published monthly on the London 2012 website.</p>
	<p pid="a.994W.2/4">All commercial road vehicles and construction plant used on the Olympic Park, including stationary plant, must comply with any legislative requirements. The ODA does not have data for road vehicles that are not permanently based on the Olympic Park, and the ODA has confirmed that the permanent machinery (non road mobile machinery) do not have filters fitted. However, a study is being undertaken currently that will consider the case for fitting of carbon particulate filters as well as establishing cost effectiveness of installation against other measures. The study is due to be completed in February 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.994W.2/5">New EU legislation will require that emissions of particulate pollutants are reduced in new machinery across industry. One of the methods of reducing particulates could be to introduce filters. This legislation is being introduced in a phased approach dependent on engine size over the next four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.994W.2/6">All commercial road vehicles and construction plant used on Olympics venues outside the Park must comply with the same legislative requirements; however the ODA does not hold statistics of similar depth for these venues.</p>

	<p pid="a.995W.3/3">LOCOG's approach is broadly in line with that of the ODA in that both organisations require certified timber products, although their needs and by definition their supply chains differ, with LOCOG largely focused on items such as furniture, merchandise and publications while ODA procured raw materials for construction.</p>
	<p pid="a.995W.3/4">Many businesses have directly benefited from the &#163;5 billion of contracts let by the Olympic Delivery Authority so far, 98 per cent. of which are UK companies. Businesses will continue to benefit from the remaining ODA contracts and the contracts which LOCOG will be procuring. When deciding which of the Government-approved policies to follow in the procurement of timber, LOCOG took a business decision taking into account ethical and operational considerations including ease of monitoring and verification. UK businesses are well placed to bid for the various timber contracts for London 2012.</p>

This assessment estimated the impact on broad groupings which would be affected. Voluntary groups may also be charities and it is not possible to separate them out further.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.2/3">The exact impact will be determined by the outcome of consultations between Phonographic Performance Ltd. (PPL) and organisations concerned on licence fee levels. However, PPL has stated that its current equivalent commercial fees range between &#163;54 and &#163;108 per year and it envisages that most organisations will pay fees at the lower end of this range or even lower. They have also confirmed that they will not charge in a number of circumstances including music used as part of divine worship and family occasions such as weddings.</p>

	<p pid="a.1005W.0/1">The terms &quot;open PSN case&quot; and &quot;open P14 case&quot; are not used by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.0/2">PAYE open cases arise when HMRC is unable to match the pay and tax details submitted by their employer on form P14 to an individual's tax record or a match is made but the pay and tax do not reconcile and further work is needed to establish the correct tax position. This is a normal part of the PAYE process.</p>

	<p pid="a.1005W.0/10">From 2009, the introduction of the new National Insurance and PAYE Service (NPS) will automate matching and processing of data sufficient to reduce the number of cases needing clerical intervention (exception cases) to less than 4.5 million each tax year. HMRC aims to clear these cases during the same year in which they occur so backlogs should no longer accrue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.0/11">For the open cases existing when NPS went live HMRC have three pieces of work planned to reduce the existing open cases:</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.0/12" class="indent">1. An Open Case Clearance Project in PAYE/SA Processing that deploys software to identify cases where an under or overpayment is due, or where the record is accurate and can be closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.0/13" class="indent">2. HMRC is working with an independent firm, on those open cases which are open because they do not appear to match to an existing record, to data match open cases with a wider range of data.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.0/14" class="indent">3. The Department will risk assess the remaining cases, prioritising those where repayments may be due, before starting a clerical review of the remaining cases in April 2010, which will continue until all backlogs have been worked.</p>

	<p pid="a.1010W.3/1">The Department of Energy and Climate Change and its predecessors have implemented a large number of policies to address energy security, emissions reductions, low carbon economic growth and fuel poverty since 2000. Some of the key achievements are set out as follows, along with information on the number of households assisted by the Warm Front scheme in Blaydon constituency. It would be disproportionately costly to provide statistical information on all the impact of all the policies to the level of detail requested, but statistical information covering energy and climate change is available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1010W.3/3" class="italic"> Key achievements</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.3/4" class="indent">Total UK greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced by about 12 per cent. compared with 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.3/5" class="indent">The UK is on track to cut emissions by nearly twice our Kyoto target (22 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2008-12 compared to the target of 12.5 per cent. set out under the Kyoto agreement).</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.3/6" class="indent">The Climate Change Act in 2008 set a target of at least 80 per cent. reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050. Our first three carbon budgets legally bind the UK to a cut in greenhouse gases of 34 per cent. by 2018-22 against a 1990 baseline. In 2009, the UK's Low Carbon Transition Plan set out the long-term vision for climate change and energy and showing how we will meet the carbon budgets set out in the Climate Change Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.3/7" class="indent">In the same year, my Department published National Policy Statements on energy infrastructure which will lead to faster and fairer planning decisions and a diverse low carbon energy mix. An ambitious new framework for clean coal will also drive development of carbon capture and storage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.3/8" class="indent">The UK's energy market is the most competitive in the EU and has attracted over &#163;97 billion of investment from 1997 to 2008 (at 2005 prices). The UK also has the greatest installed capacity of offshore wind in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.3/9" class="indent">Turning to household measures, since 2002, the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) and its predecessors have helped over six million households with insulation measures with almost three million of these in a priority group of vulnerable households.</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.3/10" class="indent">Government will be providing more financial assistance to help people generate their own heat and electricity in low carbon ways, where appropriate, through 'clean energy cashback' schemes:</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.3/11" class="indent">Feed-in Tariffs (FITs) will be in place from April 2010. Payment for low carbon electricity produced by small-scale generators (including households), will be provided through the electricity supply companies to encourage the uptake of low carbon and renewable electricity generating technologies by households, businesses and communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.3/12" class="indent">The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI), scheduled for launch in April 2011, will provide households, communities and businesses with payment for getting their heat from renewable sources. The detailed design of the RHI is currently out for consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1010W.3/14">DECC's Warm Front scheme provides grants for households on qualifying income and disability related benefits to install a range of insulation and heating measures in their homes. Since 2000 the scheme has assisted 2092 households in the Blaydon constituency.</p>

	<p pid="a.1012W.2/1">The Government have a strong package of measures to help reduce fuel poverty among vulnerable households which includes pensioners. This is centred on tackling the three root causes of fuel poverty:</p>
	<p pid="a.1012W.2/2" class="indent">Reducing the demand for energy by improving home energy efficiency through schemes such as Warm Front, Carbon Emissions Reduction Target, Community Energy Saving programme and the Decent Homes Standard.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012W.2/3" class="indent">Between 2005 and the end of January 2010 Warm Front delivered energy efficiency measures to 2702 households in Hemsworth;</p>
	<p pid="a.1012W.2/4" class="indent">Putting in place and continuously looking to improve a regulatory framework that promotes competition as the main driver to ensure downward pressure on prices for consumers, and to improve licence conditions and strengthen Ofgem's powers through the Energy Bill; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1012W.2/5" class="indent">Raising real incomes, including through winter fuel payments and cold weather payments alongside the wider tax and benefit system and through benefit entitlement checks under the Warm Front scheme. Over 622 such checks have been undertaken in Hemsworth by Warm Front between 2005 and the end of November 2009, identifying an average weekly increase in income of &#163;25.09 for those entitled to additional benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012W.2/6">We have also introduced legislation to implement mandated social price support schemes once the current voluntary agreement with suppliers comes to an end in 2011. These schemes will provide more of the most vulnerable consumers with help towards their energy costs. We have said that we are minded to focus the majority of the additional resources on older pensioner households on the lowest incomes as these households tend to have a high incidence of fuel poverty-over 50 per cent. of fuel poor households have a person over 60 living in them; their circumstances are relatively stable; and they are at the greatest risk of excess winter deaths.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012W.2/7">Through our fuel poverty review we will continue to build and strengthen the evidence base on fuel poverty and explore better ways of targeting help at the most vulnerable fuel poor households.</p>

	<p pid="a.1013W.0/1">The Department of Energy and Climate Change and its predecessors have implemented a large number of policies to address energy security, emissions reductions, low carbon economic growth and fuel poverty since 2000. Some of the key achievements are set out as follows, along with information on the number of households assisted by the Warm Front scheme in Hemsworth constituency. It would be disproportionately costly to provide statistical information on all the impact of all the policies to the level of detail requested, but statistical information covering energy and climate change is available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1013W.0/3" class="italic"> Key achievements</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.0/4" class="indent">Total UK greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced by about 12 per cent. compared with 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.0/5" class="indent">The UK is on track to cut emissions by nearly twice our Kyoto target (22 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2008-12 compared to the target of 12.5 per cent. set out under the Kyoto agreement).</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.0/6" class="indent">The Climate Change Act in 2008 set a target of at least 80 per cent. reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050. Our first three carbon budgets legally bind the UK to a cut in greenhouse gases of 34 per cent. by 2018-22 against a 1990 baseline. In 2009, the UK's Low Carbon Transition Plan set out the long-term vision for climate change and energy and showing how we will meet the carbon budgets set out in the Climate Change Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.0/7" class="indent">In the same year, my department published National Policy Statements on energy infrastructure which will lead to faster and fairer planning decisions and a diverse low carbon energy mix. An ambitious new framework for clean coal will also drive development of carbon capture and storage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.0/8" class="indent">The UK's energy market is the most competitive in the EU and has attracted over &#163;97 billion of investment from 1997 to 2008 (at 2005 prices). The UK also has the greatest installed capacity of offshore wind in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.0/9" class="indent">Turning to household measures, since 2002, the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) and its predecessors have helped over six million households with insulation measures with almost three million of these in a priority group of vulnerable households.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.0/10" class="indent">Government will be providing more financial assistance to help people generate their own heat and electricity in low carbon ways, where appropriate, through &quot;clean energy cashback&quot; schemes:</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.0/11" class="indent">Feed-in Tariffs (FITs) will be in place from April 2010. Payment for low carbon electricity produced by small-scale generators (including households), will be provided through the electricity supply companies to encourage the uptake of low carbon and renewable electricity generating technologies by households, businesses and communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.0/12" class="indent">The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI), scheduled for launch in April 2011, will provide households, communities and businesses with payment for getting their heat from renewable sources. The detailed design of the RHI is currently out for consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.0/13" class="italic"> Warm Front scheme: Hemsworth constituency</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.0/14">DECC's Warm Front scheme provides grants for households on qualifying income and disability related benefits to install a range of insulation and heating measures in their homes. Since 2005 the scheme has assisted 2694 households in the Hemsworth constituency.</p>

	<p pid="a.1014W.0/2">Projections about grid decarbonisation are already taken into account in the carbon emission factors that are used to determine carbon compliance. The factor is currently calculated by projecting five years into the future, based on an average value of carbon intensity. Officials from DECC and CLG are working closely with the zero carbon hub's working group that has been set up to consider issues such as compliance and its assessment, as we move to zero carbon homes in 2016. The carbon intensity of grid energy, electricity, gas and the other fuels, is likely to be a factor in their deliberations. The workgroup is expected to make its recommendations later this year.</p>

Weight is only one factor in manual handling risk and HSE has worked with the industry and IATA to introduce, first, a recommended 32 kilo bag weight limit, then, in 2009, a recommended 23 kilo limit.</p>

As soon as that information is available it will be placed in the Libraries of the House. It should be noted that, as per best practice, the MCA keeps financial records only for the previous six financial years so therefore will not be able to provide information prior to financial year 2004-05.</p>

It is the view of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) that the resources available for search and rescue in the southern part of the South West Peninsula are sufficient to address the known maritime risks for that location, without the need for an additional boat at Hope Cove, whether or not that they were privately run.

These reviews have been used to inform commitments in the recent &quot;Putting the Front Line First: Smarter Government&quot; White Paper. Specific commitments include removing indicators that are no longer relevant or needed by April 2010 and reducing the overall number of national indicators against which local authorities will have to report their performance for the next spending period. The White Paper also invited the current Total Place pilots to provide information on the costs of assessment and inspection to inform the Smarter Government workstreams.

	<p pid="a.1034W.2/19">In the last five years, alongside rising petrol prices and increasing turnover, the rents paid on many petrol filling stations have grown. It is only fair to all ratepayers this is reflected in rate bills. The Government have put in place a &#163;2 billion relief scheme to limit the impact on the minority with bill increases, which in 2010-11 will ensure no business property sees its rates bill increase by more than 11 per cent. as a result of the revaluation, with maximum increases capped at just 3.5 per cent. for small properties. That is on top of the wider support available to help ease business pressures including discounted rate bills for small businesses and deferring tax payments.</p>

That is on top of the wider support available to help ease business pressures including discounted rate bills for small businesses and deferring tax payments.</p>

If the tests prove successful and it can be financially justified Windows 7 will be used when new equipment is issued to Members. Given the timescales for the withdrawal of Windows 2000 support and the relatively recent availability of Windows 7 the move to Windows Vista for administrative staff was considered the best option given the circumstances.</p>

These factors together account for about 75 per cent. of the 5,300 cases of oral cancer occurring annually in the United Kingdom. There is also evidence of an association with the human papillomavirus and low intake of fresh fruit and vegetables. Tobacco usage and alcohol consumption are also associated with cancer of the oesophagus and larynx, together with diet and family history, but information is not available on which to base estimates of their relative significance.</p>

	<p pid="a.1045W.8/1">The Government have put in place a programme of national health service investment and reform since 1997 to improve service delivery in all parts of the United Kingdom. 93 per cent. of people nationally now rate the NHS as good or excellent. The NHS Constitution contains 25 rights and 14 pledges for patients and the public including new rights to be treated within 18 weeks, or be seen by a cancer specialist within two weeks and an NHS health check every five years for those aged 40-74 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/2">There is significant evidence that these policies have yielded considerable benefits for the Hemsworth constituency. For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/3">Figures for November 2009 show that in Wakefield District Primary Care Trust (PCT):</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/4">95 per cent, of patients whose treatment involved admission to hospital started their treatment within 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/5">98 per cent. of patients whose treatment did not involve admission to hospital started their treatment within 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/6">In September 2009, at Mid-Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, 99.2 per cent. of patients spent less than four hours in accident and emergency from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/7">Between September 2002 and September 2008, the number of consultants at Mid-Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust has increased from 202 to 248. Between September 2002 and September 2008, the number of doctors in training has increased from 261 to 379.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/8">Between September 2001 and September 2008, the number of general practitioners (GPs) per 100,000 within Wakefield District PCT has increased from 62.8 to 73.1.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/9">91.5 per cent. of urgent GP referrals to Mid-Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust with suspected cancer are seen by a specialist within two weeks of the referral.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/10">Wakefield District PCT opened its GP-led health centre, the King Street Health Centre, in June 2009. Wakefield District residents and visitors will be able to see a GP or nurse as a walk-in patient between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week, 365 days a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/11">There is one private finance initiative (PFI) scheme in the area that serves this constituency: work is under way on the major &#163;353 million PR development to replace Pinderfields General Hospital and refurbish Pontefract General Infirmary. The first services in the new Pontefract Hospital opened in January 2010. Overall completion of the two hospitals is expected in January 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/12">Although statistical information is not available at a local level, Hemsworth will have also benefited from national policies in other areas. For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/13">Since 1997, gross current expenditure on personal social services has increased by around 70 per cent. in real terms, with around 105,000 households now receiving intensive home care and 3,076 new extra care housing units-exceeding the original target of 1,500 new extra care units.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/14">Other strategies currently being implemented are:</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/15">Subject to parliamentary approval, the Personal Care at Home Bill will guarantee free personal care for 280,000 people with the highest needs and help around 130,000 people who need home care for the first time to regain their independence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/16">Shaping the Future of Care Together Green Paper, published in July 2009, sets out a vision of a National Care Service for all adults in England that is fair, simple and affordable. The Department has consulted widely on this reform and is currently analysing the responses, which will feed into a White Paper later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/17">The National Carer's Strategy - Carers at the heart of 21st century families and communities was launched in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/18">The first National Dementia Strategy was published in February 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/19">Valuing People Now-a three year strategy for people with learning disabilities-was published in January 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/20">New Horizons: A Shared Vision for Mental Health was launched in December 2009 to maintain improvements in mental health services, combined with a new cross-Government approach to promoting public mental health.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/21">Since 1998, there are now 2.4 million fewer smokers in England as a result of the Government's comprehensive tobacco control strategy, which has a measurable impact on reducing smoking prevalence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/22">Child obesity levels are reducing due to the efforts of families across England, supported by the Government's obesity strategy. In 2008, 13.9 per cent, of children (aged two to 10) in England were classified as obese, compared with 17.3 per cent. in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/23">Overall, life expectancy at birth for men has increased from 74.5 years (1995-1997 data) to 77.7 years (2006-08 data) while for women, life expectancy at birth has increased from 79.6 years (1995-97 data) to 81.9 years (2006-08 data).</p>

QMAE remains the official source of information on A&amp;E attendances and performance on the 4-hour standard. The NHS Plan sets out that no one should wait more than four hours in A&amp;E from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge. To allow for exceptional circumstances, the operational standard of 98.0 per cent. has been adopted.</p>

We encourage local agencies to consider the full range of innovations and schemes and practices intended to reduce crime, the fear of crime and antisocial behaviour. It is for local agencies to decide on the most appropriate interventions based on their knowledge of what works best locally.

	<p pid="a.1055W.11/1">Total recorded crime in Wales fell by 3 per cent. in 2008-09 compared with 2007-08. Violence against the person fell by 4 per cent. and domestic burglary by 7 per cent. According to quarterly statistics released in January 2010, total recorded crime in Wales fell by 3 per cent., violence against the person by 2 per cent. and domestic burglary by 6 per cent. in the 12 months to September 2009 as compared to September 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.11/2">These falls have been supported by investment in preventive measures to reduce crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.11/3">Wales received &#163;317,748 in 2009-10 as part of the Safer Homes programme to provide target hardening to 3,500 vulnerable properties identified through local intelligence. Wales received a further &#163;384,208 investment in the same period through the Small Retailers Capital Fund to help enhance the security of vulnerable local businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.11/4">A strong focus on alcohol-related violent crime has revolved around the introduction of a formal and structured programme of complementary projects such as Taxi Marshalling. HOCTiW is leading the 'Health and Crime Data Sharing Initiative' which aims to improve the sharing of A and E data with all Community Safety Partnerships across Wales through the roll out of the Cardiff model. They have also initiated a data exchange programme between the Welsh Ambulance Service and all Community Safety Partnerships in Wales. These initiatives will contribute to providing a better understanding of violence and more effective targeting of resources to tackle violent crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.11/5">Knife crime offences are low within Wales compared to other parts of the UK. Therefore energy is being concentrated on preventative work with young people. South Wales police, funded by the Home Office, have engaged young people to produce an interactive, educational DVD 'At Life Point', targeted at 11 to 18-year-olds, aimed at increasing awareness of the effects and consequences of carrying knives.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.11/6">Multi Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARACs) are embedded throughout Wales which enables key statutory and voluntary organisations to work together to increase the safety, health and well-being of victims, adults and their children and reduce repeat victimisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.11/7">In order to reduce drug misuse the Home Office and Welsh Assembly Government are working together to deliver the Tough Choices Project, which went live on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase>. By facilitating offenders engagement and retention in treatment, these measures will reduce the amount of crime that is committed by offenders in order to fund their drug misuse. British Crime Survey results show that the proportion of people who perceive there to be a high level of drug use or drug dealing in Wales has fallen in the 12 months to Sept ember 2009 compared with the 12 months to September 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.11/8">The Home Office Crime Team in Wales (HOCTiW) has driven and facilitated improvements in priority and prolific offenders (PPO) schemes across Wales by a variety of methods including PPO walkthroughs, securing capital funding to establish co-location of key agencies and IT case management systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.11/9">South Wales has adopted the i-NSI approach to increase public confidence. This relates to an innovative community engagement methodology designed to deliver a richer community intelligence picture of neighbourhoods and their problems. Based upon a software package written specifically for the purpose, the approach allows front-line staff to diagnose the signal crimes and signal disorders that are driving insecurity at the local level. The recently published British Crime Survey figures show that the proportion of people in South Wales who agree that the police and local councils are dealing with the ASB and crime issues that matter in their area is statistically significantly higher in the 12 months to Sept ember 2009 compared to the 12 months to September 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.1057W.2/1">As part of the Tackling Violence Action plan, launched in February 2008, and the Tackling Knives Action programme, launched in June 2008, the Home Office provided 1,150 extra search arches and wands to police forces in England and Wales to take knives off the streets and reassure the public. This is in addition to search equipment sourced directly by forces. As a result of on-going activity, police forces tell us that there are encouraging signs that knife carrying is reducing among young people.</p>

	<p pid="a.1057W.5/1">Enforcement of legal restrictions on us of the M4 bus lane is an operational matter for the police. Metropolitan police traffic officers are regularly deployed on that section of the M4 which includes the bus lane. They can deal with its illegal use by giving an oral or written warning, the issue of a &#163;60 fixed penalty notice or by proceeding to prosecution. Any police officer who witnesses an offence taking place there will take whatever action is appropriate in the circumstances. In addition, I understand that the Metropolitan police are working in partnership with the Highways Agency and Transport for London to devise medium and long-term solutions in relation to the lane's use and safety.</p>

	<p pid="a.1070W.11/1">The Ministry of Justice welcomes the fact that the 10:10 campaign will increase awareness among the public and business about climate change and sustainability. It will help to develop a higher profile of this issue in those sectors that are yet to set themselves any targets for improvement. Some of these businesses will also be our suppliers and this campaign should therefore serve to secure improvements in our supply chain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070W.11/2">Prior to the 10:10 campaign being established, the MOJ had already committed to working towards the stretching long-term pan Government-mandated Sustainable Operations on the Government Estate (SOGE) targets to reduce carbon emissions from offices by:</p>
	<p pid="a.1070W.11/3" class="indent">12.5 per cent. by 2010-11, relative to 1999-2000 levels, and</p>
	<p pid="a.1070W.11/4" class="indent">30 per cent. by 2020, relative to 1999-2000 levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070W.11/5">Although we are only required to report on the &quot;office estate&quot;, i.e. buildings where professional, administrative or clerical duties are performed, as a further demonstration of the Ministry's commitment to sustainability, the MOJ has chosen to work towards and report on SOGE targets on the wider estate. To that end the Ministry has initiatives in place to reduce carbon emissions throughout our business operations not only in the office estate but also in courts, tribunals and prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070W.11/6">HM Courts Service carried out a Low Carbon Technology study in 2008-09, looking at possibility of retro fitting low-to-zero carbon technologies into the existing estate. Many of the. recommendations are now being acted on, for instance, a boiler and air conditioning replacement programme is under way to replace old, inefficient equipment and a trial of voltage optimisation equipment is being carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070W.11/7">HM Prison Service launched its own Carbon Management Programme in 2008 and attained the Carbon Trust Standard in April 2009. An innovative project involving Custodial Property and the Carbon Trust subsidiary, Partnerships for Renewables (PfR), has led to a generic options agreement being put in place to erect large scale wind turbines on prison land. An options lease with PfR has been signed for the Sheppey prison with more to follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070W.11/8">We are also working towards the SOGE target to reduce carbon emissions from road vehicles used for Government administrative operations by 15 per cent. by 2010-11, relative to 2005-06 levels. The MOJ fleets are on target to meet Government targets for all new vehicles coming into service by 2010 of 130 g/km, while we already only procure vehicles that conform to the EU emission requirements set for manufacturers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070W.11/9">HM Government's UK Low Carbon Transition Plan, published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-15">15 July 2009</phrase>, announced that all Departments would publish a 'Carbon Reduction Delivery Plan', the Ministry of Justice will produce its plan this spring 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070W.11/10">The Ministry of Justice and its agencies do not consider it appropriate to sign up to a short-term campaign such as the 10:10 campaign target as it already has an ambitious carbon reduction strategy already in place to meet the Government mandated targets. Going forward a key part of the strategy are projects to establish better quality, more frequent data through the use of Automatic Meter Reading (AMR), enabling more timely action to be taken to reduce energy consumption. Other projects include plans to upgrade building services and to optimise energy use both through technological measures and better energy management practice. The MOJ will continue with its carbon reduction work streams already in place and we will continue to promote the long-term and structured work we have been doing to reduce carbon usage.

	<p pid="a.1071W.2/1">Sick absence data for the MOJ (excluding the National Offender Management Service-NOMS) cannot be broken down to the level of detail requested and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.2/2">4,461 directly employed civil servants in the National Offender Management Service have taken at least five periods of sickness absence, of less than five days duration between the inception of Ministry of Justice on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May 2007</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-31">31 December 2009</phrase>. This represents 7.2 per cent. of all staff employed over this period. An absence of less than five days is defined as an absence where the return to work date is less than five calendar days after the first day of absence. No account is taken of rest days.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.2/3">The general trend in sick absence levels in the MOJ is downwards. In the 12 month period to March 2009 the average working days lost per person was 9.8 (10.7 days per person in NOMS and 8.0 days per person in the wider MOJ). This reduced to 9.5 days per person in the 12 months to September 2009 (10.5 days per person in NOMS and 7.5 days per person in the wider MOJ).</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.2/4">In the 12 months to September 2009 57 per cent. of absence was due to long-term sickness, where absence is greater than 20 working days.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.2/5">The MOJ takes the management of sickness absences extremely seriously and is committed to an attendance management system that will help reduce the number of sickness absences while supporting the well-being of its employees.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.2/6">The MOJ continues to focus management attention on reducing sick absence. Working proactively with external occupational health providers, there have been significant improvements in referral turnaround times. New, more streamlined and simplified attendance policies have been introduced during 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.2/7">Further work is also focused on well-being and to support this work we have undertaken a fundamental review of the occupational health (OH) delivery model. The re-tender of the contract for external OH services has been progressed on the basis of this new delivery model, which at its core has a focus on proactive case management and an on-site occupational health adviser at every NOMS HQ and prison service location.</p>

	<p pid="a.1077W.2/1">The review panel arrangements were put in place in 2000 but since October 2006, the LSC has moved away from the old regional panel structure for the majority of funding/costs appeals which are now dealt with by single independent funding/costs adjudicators. There are therefore no chair or vice-chair representing these adjudicators. The appointment of individual adjudicators is made in accordance with the criteria and guidance on the LSC Review Panel Arrangements 2000 (as amended), which is available on the LSC website.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077W.2/2">A panel can sit where the complexity or profile of a case justifies this; however, such panels have been required on fewer than 10 occasions under the post-2006 arrangements. All other appeals (either against refusal of funding or assessment of costs) have been heard by single adjudicators.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077W.2/3">The Special Cases Unit (SCU) has its own panel and they work as single adjudicators or in committees of between three and five when required depending upon the complexity or value of the cases. The Chair of the SCU Panel is Andrew Watson, a solicitor in private practice. He was appointed in July 2008. The Vice Chair of the SCU Panel is Simon Sinnatt, a barrister in private practice. He was appointed in July 2008.</p>

The Offender Management Act 2007 strengthened the penalties for smuggling contraband, and made it a specific offence with a penalty of up to two years' imprisonment to bring a mobile phone or component part into a prison.</p>

	<p pid="a.1078W.8/1">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) has recently made amendments to prison rule 39, which covers the confidential handling arrangements for the delivery of legally privileged material to prisoners. This was introduced by way of a negative statutory instrument which was laid before Parliament in November 2009 and came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January 2010</phrase> (SI 3082-2009). This clarified that the level of authorisation for the interception of such communications had been raised from governing governor of a prison to the chief operating officer of NOMS. It also made clear that there should be no distinction between legally privileged material which was delivered as correspondence or documentation (electronic or other) which was handed over during the course of a legal visits. Both should be afforded the same level of confidential handling arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1078W.8/2">NOMS is also considering whether any additional practical steps might be taken to reduce the scope for abuse of rule 39, without risk of compromise to legal privilege.</p>

To provide the information requested would involve requesting and collating information from all prisons which could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.1100W.5/2">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Darra Singh. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100W.5/3" class="italic"> Letter from Darra Singh:</p>
	<p pid="a.1100W.5/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what training (a) Jobcentre Plus staff and (b) medical staff in her Department have received in relation to the administration of special rules for Employment and Support Allowance for people with cancer. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100W.5/5" class="indent">As part of the training for administering Employment and Support Allowance, Jobcentre Plus staff access three specific training events delivered in a classroom environment amounting to six hours of learning. The events provide an overview of 'Support Group' customers whose health conditions, including those with cancer, mean it is unreasonable to require them to engage in work related activities, and customers who satisfy 'Special Rules' conditions whereby they are not expected to live for more than six months. The training provides staff with an understanding of the Work Capability Assessment process and how customers falling into these categories are identified. The training also provides trainees with an understanding of the actions they are expected to take, and how the rules and conditionality affect customers with cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100W.5/6" class="indent">Additionally, all healthcare professionals working for Atos Healthcare who carry out special rules checks for Employment and Support Allowance receive training in both the medical and administrative aspects of the referrals. Administrative components of the training include the use of relevant computer systems, dealing promptly with the referrals and obtaining further medical evidence if required, usually by telephoning clinicians involved in the customer's medical treatment. The medical aspects of the training cover areas such as the application of the healthcare professional's medical knowledge in relation to the relevant benefit entitlement criteria.</p>

	<p pid="a.1101W.5/1">The Government are taking decisive steps in Wales, and across the UK, to reduce unemployment and is committed to helping people return to work. It is for this reason that we have made available up to &#163;5 billion, since November 2008, to offer substantial new support to jobseekers to help them find work at all stages of their claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.5/2">We have quadrupled funding to the rapid response service which provides support to employees under threat of redundancy, helping to prevent them falling into long-term unemployment. We have also significantly increased funding to maintain and increase the existing support that is available to newly unemployed claimants through Jobcentre Plus and its external partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.5/3">As well as help with jobsearch skills and access to basic skills training, newly unemployed people now have day-one access to Local Employment Partnership vacancies, help to meet the expenses involved in finding work and, for some, work trials.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.5/4">In April 2009, we strengthened this support by introducing group jobsearch sessions specifically targeted at newly unemployed people, as well as specialist back to work support for newly unemployed professionals and executives, delivered through recruitment agencies. We also introduced a substantial package of support, the six month offer, for those people who were still claiming jobseeker's allowance after six months. This offer provides unemployed people with access to recruitment subsidies, self-employment help, volunteering opportunities and work-focused training.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.5/5">The Government have also targeted significant new resource on young people in recognition of the particular challenges young people face during a recession. Young people in Wales will now benefit from the young person's guarantee, launched by the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-25">25 January</phrase>. This guarantees an offer of a job, training or work experience to all 18-24 year olds who have been claiming JSA for six months.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.5/6">The future jobs fund, part of the young person's guarantee, has already created around 9700 jobs across Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.5/7">In addition, people who have been claiming jobseeker's allowance for 12 months or longer have access to the new flexible new deal which offers tailored, flexible help and support, particularly for those people who experience repeated cycles of unemployment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.5/8">Furthermore, we are providing additional support for people who need extra help in the deprived areas in Wales through the City Strategy Pathfinders of Rhyl and Heads of the Valleys, two additional partnerships (Swansea Bay and Mon Menai), and Jobcentre Plus districts with deprived wards not covered by these specific initiatives. The Department for Work and Pensions is contributing approximately &#163;12.4 million to these initiatives from its deprived areas fund (DAF) during 2009-11.</p>

	<p pid="a.1102W.2/2">Teenage parents have access to a wide range of pre and post employment support. This includes the new deal for lone parents and new deal for partners. Both programmes offer eligible parents, aged 16 years and over, access to a specialist personal adviser and a package of support, including training, tailored to the circumstances of the individual.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102W.2/3">Everyone making a claim to jobseeker's allowance (JSA) has an initial interview with a personal adviser to discuss their employment goals and how they will go about achieving those goals. In addition to the support available to all new JSA customers, those aged between 18 and 24 have access to extra adviser support and programmes, such as mentoring and work experience, designed specifically for this age group; those who have less than six months post-education work experience also have immediate access to the work trial programme. All 18-year-old new claimants have the opportunity to attend a 'group jobsearch session' which offers wide ranging advice on job-hunting and provides information on the services offered by Connexions/Careers Service in relation to education and training.</p>

Some other 18 (and 19) year olds, those considered to be at greatest disadvantage in the labour market, have voluntary access to this more intensive support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102W.2/5">All 18 to 24-year-olds entering stage three of the flexible new deal process or the new deal gateway, are eligible for the young person's guarantee; an offer of a job, training or work experience. Individuals can be fast-tracked to early access to this provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102W.2/6">A small number of 16 and 17-year-olds are also able to claim JSA, mainly those in 'severe hardship'. These customers will see a specialist adviser in Jobcentre Plus and the vast majority of them must, as a condition of their claim, register for work and training with Connexions/Careers Service who are best placed to provide advice and guidance to this age group.</p>

	<p pid="a.1110W.3/1">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) provides funding to further education (FE) colleges and training providers to support adults (aged 19 and older) undertaking courses in literacy, numeracy and English for speakers of other languages (ESOL). Since the launch of the Skills for Life Strategy in 2001, it is estimated that &#163;5 billion has been invested in Skills for Life provision (for those aged 16 and older) up until 2008. Nearly six million adults (aged 19 and older) across England have taken courses to improve their literacy, language and numeracy skills since 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.1110W.3/2">LSC funding is not allocated at the local authority level. Planned investment in Skills for Life at a national level is based on estimated levels of activity for an academic year. The amount of funding routed through Adult Learner Responsive and Train to Gain routes for Skills for Life is estimated at nearly &#163;600 million for 2008-09 financial year and around &#163;630 million for 2009-10 financial year, as set out in the Skills Investment Strategy 2010-11 (November 2009). The actual amount spent on Skills for Life literacy and numeracy provision will depend on learner and employer demand.</p>

	<p pid="a.1112W.5/2">The Government did not make any specific assessment of the effects on <i> (a)</i> Staffordshire Moorlands constituency or <i> (b)</i> the West Midlands. However, as part of our consultation process we commissioned a final impact assessment from independent consultants, Europe Economics. This assessment estimated the impact on groups across the UK which would be affected. It was published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-12">12 November 2009</phrase> with the Government Response and a summary was placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1112W.5/3">The exact impact will be determined by the outcome of consultations between Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL) and organisations concerned on licence fee levels. We value the contribution musical performers make to the economic and cultural success of our country. We have got to make sure that they are rewarded for their efforts so they can continue creating. As part of this process it is essential that PPL work with the third sector to agree reasonable and appropriate tariffs. The Government want to ensure that discussions between PPL and the third sector are facilitated so that the outcome is satisfactory for all concerned. A mutually agreed solution is vital if the needs of both PPL members and the third sector are to be met. I remain confident that this will be possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.1114W.0/71" class="indent">Within this Agency, there are five levels, in the sense of Grades, at which managerial responsibilities can be exercised. These are: Senior Civil Servant (myself), Grade 6 (four staff currently in post), Grade 7 (10 staff), Senior Executive Officer (5 staff) and Higher Executive officer (2 managers at this level).</p>
	<p pid="a.1114W.0/72" class="indent">Managerial responsibility is only one of the factors taken into account when deciding on the grading of a post and there are therefore a couple of Grade 7s and several SEOs who are not managers, in so far as they do not have other members of staff reporting directly to them. In addition the vast majority of HEO staff do not carry out managerial functions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1114W.0/73" class="indent">In practice NMO operates flat structures, which means that it is very unusual to operate with all five of the above mentioned levels. Structures also differ according to the nature of the work-management spans are much wider in the laboratories, for instance, than they are in policy areas. At present, I have 7 direct reports; there is one layer of management between myself and 19 staff; two levels of management in the case of 28 staff; and three levels of management in the case of 11 staff. In only four cases are there four layers of management/supervision between myself and employees. The Agency currently has 66 staff in post. Please note that these do not include vacancies and are expressed in terms of individuals, not Full Time Equivalents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1114W.0/74" class="indent">The last complete year for which audited financial information is available is 2008/09, which was before the shape of the agency was significantly altered with the transfer to us of responsibility for the National Measurement System and the Teddington Estate. I regret, therefore, that meaningful information could only be provided at disproportionate cost.

	<p pid="a.1114W.0/76" class="indent">The Minister of State, for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) has asked me to reply to your question how many layers of management reporting from the most senior to the most junior there are in his Department and each of its agencies; how many officials are employed in each such layer; and how much was spent on salaries and associated employment costs of staff at each such layer in the latest year for which information is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1114W.0/77" class="indent">The Insolvency Service has 6 layers of management reporting, and the number of staff within each layer is shown in the table below based on full-time equivalent staff numbers. The costs shown are based on salary, superannuation and national insurance contributions projected annually from December 2009's payroll. However, not all B1-C2 grade staff are managers, and the number of managers at each of these grades could only be established at a disproportionate cost.</p>

Independent evaluation from the university of Glasgow found that Enterprise UK hubs 'had a substantial impact' within their target areas, 'considerable local influence', and 'largely offset what would otherwise have been a declining local enterprise culture'.</p>

	<p pid="a.1119W.2/15">Enterprise UK was set up as a campaigning organisation in 2004 by the Confederation of British Industry, the Federation of Small Businesses, the Institute of Directors and the British Chambers of Commerce, and continues to be led by their Directors General. Enterprise UK is funded by BIS to promote entrepreneurship in the UK, particularly amongst audiences that have characteristically strong attitudes towards starting businesses but have a below average proportion who actually do, such as young people, women and particular black and minority ethnic groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.1119W.2/16">Programmes funded by BIS and led by Enterprise UK include Global Entrepreneurship Week, the Make Your Mark campaign and the Enterprising Young Brits and Enterprising Britain competitions. The organisation is able to leverage substantial in kind support to supplement its funding; for example in 2008-09 this included &#163;2.3 million worth of time spent by leading UK entrepreneurs who act as ambassadors and mentors and &#163;7.25 million media coverage. Funding for Enterprise UK from BIS has been reduced over the past two years, as the organisation has sought other funding streams and increased private sector collaboration for delivery of its projects.</p>

	<p pid="a.1120W.5/1">Government have in place a number of targets to reduce digital exclusion by giving people access to online services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1120W.5/2" class="indent">1. Through the Smarter Government programme, Government's aim is to have 100 per cent. of its services online by 2014. We also announced in November, as part of Smarter Government, that we will be giving UK online centres a further &#163;30 million to get one million people online.</p>
	<p pid="a.1120W.5/3" class="indent">2. Starting in 2010, the Government's Home Access programme (&#163;300 million), children at key stages 2 and 3 who are eligible for free school meals will also be eligible for a home access grant. This will provide a free computer and one year's internet use. The aim is to help over 270,000 households by March 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.1120W.5/4" class="indent">3. We are working closely with Martha Lane Fox, the champion for digital inclusion, who is also a member of the consortium for the promotion of digital participation through her &quot;Race Online 2012&quot; campaign, for six million people who are both digitally and socially excluded to get online by 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.1120W.5/5" class="indent">4. The national plan for digital participation which will be launched in March will announce further figures to encourage the remaining 30 per cent. of the population to get online.</p>
	<p pid="a.1120W.5/6" class="indent">5. Accessibility is a key issue for this Government. Websites owned by central Government Departments must be Double-A conformant by December 2009. This includes websites due to converge on Directgov or BusinessLink, unless convergence is scheduled before this date. Websites owned by central Government Executive Agencies and non-departmental public bodies must conform by March 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.1122W.8/1">The Government did not undertake any region by region assessment and therefore West Midlands was not considered on an individual basis. However, as part of the consultation process a final impact assessment was commissioned from independent consultants, Europe Economics.

	<p pid="a.1124W.0/2"><i> </i>The Government want a copyright system which achieves the correct balance between the interests of all parties. It is essential that third sector organisations are protected from excessive burdens and experience minimal disruption as they continue to provide their vital services. We must find a balance which is fair to both sides and is consistent with EU and international law.</p>
	<p pid="a.1124W.0/3">The Government consider the current exemptions do not draw the correct balance between the interests of right holders and charitable and not-for-profit organisations. It is for this reason the maintenance of the status quo was not consulted on as an option for reforming the current system of exemptions. At present, if charities wish to play recorded or broadcast music they will have to pay for a licence from the Performing Rights Society (PRS for Music), which provides remuneration to songwriters and music publishers. But third sector organisations are exempt under UK law from requiring a PPL licence, which provides remuneration to performers and record labels, if certain conditions are met. The proposed repeal means that charities will now pay performers and record companies for the public playing of their recorded or broadcast music, in the same way as they already pay songwriters and music publishers.</p>

The Government wants to ensure that discussions between PPL and the third sector are facilitated so that the outcome is satisfactory for all concerned. A mutually agreed solution is vital if the needs of both PPL members and the third sector are to be met. I remain confident that this will be possible.</p>
